      <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach the world <em>technical sophistication</em>, which includes both "hard skills" like coding, command lines, and version control, and "soft skills" like guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe ther are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/#email_list">sign up for our official email list</a> now.

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the <a href="http://www.softcover.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>. This page is part of the sample site for <a href="https://learnenough.com/css-tutorial"><em>Learn Enough CSS and Layout to Be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of <strong>C</strong>ascading <strong>S</strong>tyle <strong>S</strong>heets, the language that allows web pages to be styled.

    <h2>THE COURSES</h2>
    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least a billion people, and probably more.

            <strong>Computer Science</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>Prerequisite: Geometry or Concurrent Enrollment</em></strong><br>This is a beginner's level approach to computer programming using the Java language. No previous knowledge of programming is necessary. Students will develop and apply algorithms to solve real-world problems. Programming concepts will be taught using structured programming techniques such as data types, program input/output, if statements, loops, arrays, and lists. Object-oriented programming will also be introduced. Other topics include debugging, hardware components, and social implications of computer systems. Upon completion of this course, the student will have created software programs using computer science programming concepts. <em>This course may qualify as a technology applications credit.</em>
          </p>

            <strong>Pre-AP Computer Science</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>Prerequisite: Geometry or Concurrent Enrollment</em></strong><br>Pre-AP CS covers the same topics as on-level Computer Science but in greater depth and rigor. No previous knowledge of programming is necessary; however, students need excellent reasoning abilities and problem solving skills. Object-oriented concepts will receive more emphasis. This course is designed as a preparation for programming at the college level. <em>This course may qualify as a technology applications credit.</em>

            <strong>AP Computer Science</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>Prerequisite: Computer Science</em></strong><br>This course continues the study of computer programming using the Java language. Object oriented programming and class design will be studied in depth. Topics include 2D arrays, searching and sorting algorithms, and recursion. Social and ethical ramifications of computers in society will also be addressed. Programming assignments will, in general, be more extensive, and include the use of case studies. This course is intended for students who want to pursue careers in computer science, mathematics, engineering, or science. This college level course prepares students for the Advanced Placement Computer Science "A" Exam. <em>This course may qualify as a mathematics credit.</em>

            <strong>Advanced Computer Science</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>Prerequisite: AP Computer Science</em></strong><br>This course continues the study of computer programming using Java. Students must have mastered the topics in AP CS. This mastery is needed for CS3's study of classic data structures including linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, priority queues, and their application to algorithms such as quick-sort and heap-sort. Students will also be introduced to graph theory and extend their knowledge of recursive algorithms. Other topics may be included, such as advanced GUI techniques, multi-threaded programs, networked applications, and number theory. Beginning with the class of 2019 students in this course will receive the same weighted GPA as all AP Courses.
